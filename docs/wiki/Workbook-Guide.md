# Workbook Guide

> **Guide, not policy:** [Installation](../../INSTALLATION.md) owns the supported local setup, import and execution procedure.

SA-CCR Benchmark follows a **source-first** model:

- exported VBA under `src/` is the reviewable source of truth;
- the local macro-enabled workbook is a development/execution artifact;
- fixtures and expected values live under `tests/`; and
- generated or local execution artifacts are not authoritative source.

For normal Windows development, `tools/Sync-SACCR-VBA.cmd` updates the VBA
project in the local workbook from repository source while preserving workbook
sheet objects and their contents. It retains a safety backup only when
synchronization fails.

A source change should pass the repository static checks and, when it affects
executable VBA or numerical behaviour, be exercised in desktop Excel. See
[Excel Evidence](../EXCEL_EVIDENCE.md) and
[Repository Structure](../REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md).
