This document defines how a run of SACCR in Excel is recorded so that it can be
tied to one exact commit and checked. It is authoritative for the **evidence
record, the manual Windows/Excel procedure and the validator**. How to build the
workbook is in [`INSTALLATION.md`](../INSTALLATION.md#importing-vba-into-excel);
when evidence is required is in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[`RELEASING.md`](../RELEASING.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The validator, `tools/check_excel_evidence.py`, never runs Excel. It checks
> that a record is complete and consistent and that its sources and logs match
> the candidate commit. It cannot prove what a person did. `NOT_RUN`,
> `UNAVAILABLE`, static checks and synthetic fixtures are never an Excel pass.

Execution is **manual**: an operator runs Excel interactively. There is no
self-hosted runner, no automated Excel job, and the procedure never changes
macro security or Trust Center settings.

## 🔗 What a record binds

An evidence bundle is a folder outside the checkout containing `host.json` and
the logs it cites. The record binds:

| Item | Bound to |
| --- | --- |
| Candidate | Full 40-character commit SHA; the import log must name it |
| Sources | Every `.bas`, `.cls` and `.frm` under `src/` and `tests/` at that commit, plus each form's `.frx`, with the SHA-256 of the exact bytes stored in Git. `examples/` is not imported |
| Policy | `.github/excel-evidence-policy.json` **at that commit**: repository, entry point, ordered cases, assertion count, expected-error cases and required references |
| Environment | Excel version and build, Office bitness, Windows version and architecture, VBA runtime, references, macro policy and VBA-project access as found, and `trust_changes: false` |
| Logs | Each cited log's SHA-256; a log changed after the record was written fails |
| Harness | For a passing regression: exactly one normal-mode `TestHarness.RunTests` report whose `ENVIRONMENT`, `CASE`, count, `CLEANUP` and `RESULT` lines agree with the record and the policy |

Source digests are of the bytes **stored in Git (LF)**, not of the CRLF files
in a Windows checkout, so do not compute them with `Get-FileHash`. Print them
with the validator:

```sh
python tools/check_excel_evidence.py --candidate-sha FULL_SHA --inventory
```

The policy changes together with the harness: adding a case or an assertion to
`tests/modules/TestHarness.bas` updates `.github/excel-evidence-policy.json` in
the same pull request.

## 🧑‍💻 Manual procedure

Use Excel for Windows on a [supported host](../INSTALLATION.md#supported-hosts).
Python 3.10 or later is needed on the same machine, or on any machine with a
clone, to print the inventory and validate the bundle.

1. **Pick the candidate.** Fetch and check out the exact commit, and confirm
   the tree is clean:

   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   git switch --detach FULL_SHA
   git status
   ```

2. **Create the bundle folder** outside the checkout, for example
   `..\saccr-evidence-SHORTSHA\`. Start `session.log` there in Notepad and save
   it as UTF-8. Write the full candidate SHA and the start time with its UTC
   offset.
3. **Record the environment without changing it.** In `session.log`, note:
   - **File → Account → About Excel**: version, build and bitness;
   - **winver** and **Settings → System → About**: Windows edition, version and
     architecture;
   - **File → Options → Trust Center → Trust Center Settings**: the macro
     setting and whether *Trust access to the VBA project object model* is on.
     Do not change either.
4. **Build the workbook** exactly as in
   [Importing VBA into Excel](../INSTALLATION.md#importing-vba-into-excel): a new
   blank `.xlsm` outside the checkout, the four default references, the
   components imported in order from this checkout, then **Debug → Compile
   VBAProject**. Write in `session.log` the files imported, the references
   listed in **Tools → References** and the compile result.
5. **Run the harness once.** Clear the Immediate window (**Ctrl+G**, then
   **Ctrl+A**, **Delete**), run `TestHarness.RunTests`, and copy the whole
   Immediate-window output into `harness.log`, saved as UTF-8. Keep a failing
   report as it is: never replace it with a later passing one. Do not put a
   `RunTestsWithInjectedFailure` run in this log.
6. **Clean up.** Note the harness `CLEANUP=` line, close the test workbook, and
   record in `session.log` that it was closed and the finish time.
7. **Hash the logs**, after their last edit:

   ```sh
   python -c "import hashlib,sys;print(hashlib.sha256(open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read()).hexdigest())" harness.log
   ```

   PowerShell's `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 harness.log` gives the same
   value; this is correct for logs but not for sources.
8. **Write `host.json`** in the bundle from the [record template](#record-template),
   with the inventory from the command above and the observed values.
9. **Validate** as in [Validating a bundle](#validating-a-bundle) and keep the
   bundle with the summary. For setup and pull-request evidence, attach the
   zipped bundle and the summary to the issue or pull request.

If Excel cannot be run, write an `unavailable` record (below) and say so. Do
not fill an environment, stage or harness with values that were not observed.

## 🧾 Record template

Replace every value with what was observed. This shape is not evidence.

```json

    "os": "Windows 11 Pro 24H2 (build 26100.0000)",
    "os_architecture": "x64",
    "runtime": "VBA7+",
    "references": [
      "Visual Basic For Applications",

    ],

    "trust_changes": false
  },
  "sources": "PASTE THE --inventory OUTPUT HERE (a JSON array)",
  "stages": {
    "import": {"status": "PASS", "detail": "Imported the inventory into a new blank .xlsm", "log": {"path": "session.log", "sha256": "SESSION_LOG_DIGEST"}},
    "compile": {"status": "PASS", "detail": "Debug > Compile VBAProject completed with no error", "log": {"path": "session.log", "sha256": "SESSION_LOG_DIGEST"}},
    "regression": {"status": "PASS", "detail": "TestHarness.RunTests, complete report", "log": {"path": "harness.log", "sha256": "HARNESS_LOG_DIGEST"}},
    "cleanup": {"status": "PASS", "detail": "Harness cleanup PASS; test workbook closed", "log": {"path": "session.log", "sha256": "SESSION_LOG_DIGEST"}}
  },
  "harness": {
    "entry_point": "TestHarness.RunTests",
    "cases": 4,
    "assertions": 6,
    "failures": 0,
    "completeness": "COMPLETE",
    "expected_errors": [
      {"case": "ratio.zero-denominator", "status": "PASS", "detail": "Implied by the complete passing suite"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Rules the validator applies:

- `excel_version`, `office_bitness` and `runtime` must equal the `version`,
  `office` and `runtime` values on the harness `ENVIRONMENT=` line, and that
  line's `os` must identify Windows.
- `references` must be exactly the policy's required references, in any order.
- A stage that did not run has `"status": "NOT_RUN"` and `"log": null`. Compile
  cannot run after a failed import, nor the regression after a failed compile.
  When the regression did not run or timed out, `harness` is `null`.
- A failed regression keeps the observed counts, with `completeness` set to
  `INCOMPLETE` when the harness stopped early but still printed its report. Its
  log must be one normal-mode report whose `CASE` lines follow the policy order
  and whose counts, `CLEANUP` and `RESULT=FAIL` lines match the record; a `FAIL`
  record cannot cite a passing report.
- A regression abandoned as hung is `TIMEOUT`: keep whatever it printed as its
  log, set `harness` to `null`, and claim no counts. The log is hashed but not
  parsed, and it must have no `RESULT=` line: a run that printed one finished
  and is recorded as `PASS` or `FAIL`.
- The expected-error result is inferred from the complete passing suite, which
  includes the error-number, source and description assertions; it is not a
  separate observation.
- If the harness reports `cleanup=FAIL`, the cleanup stage must be `FAIL`.

When Excel was not run, use the same identity and time fields with
`"execution": "unavailable"`, a nonempty `availability_reason`, `operator`,
`environment` and `harness` set to `null`, `"sources": []` and `"stages": {}`.

## 🚦 Validating a bundle

From the checkout:

```sh
python tools/check_excel_evidence.py --candidate-sha FULL_SHA \
  --evidence ../saccr-evidence-SHORTSHA/host.json \
  --output test-results/excel-evidence.json --summary test-results/excel-evidence.md
```

The candidate commit must be present in the clone; the checkout does not need
to be on it. Reports must be written outside the bundle. Exit code 0 means the
record is a consistent pass, 1 a non-passing or invalid record, and 2 a command
or output error.

| Outcome | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PASS` | Complete, consistent record; every stage and the expected-error result passed |
| `IMPORT_FAILED` | Import failed |
| `COMPILE_FAILED` | Compilation failed |
| `TEST_FAILED` | The harness reported a failure |
| `CLEANUP_FAILED` | Harness or operator cleanup failed |
| `EXECUTION_TIMEOUT` | A stage was abandoned as hung |
| `INCOMPLETE` | At least one stage did not run |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | No Excel run was attempted |
| `EVIDENCE_INVALID` | Missing, malformed, contradictory or stale-source record or logs |

A record can carry several outcomes, for example `COMPILE_FAILED, INCOMPLETE`.
Keep non-passing bundles too until the finding is resolved.

## 🧱 Limits

- Source and log digests are identity controls. They do not prove what a
  workbook contained or authenticate the operator.
- A pass covers the harness on the recorded host only. It does not validate any
  SA-CCR number or any other Excel version.
- Keep logs free of credentials, client data and unredacted screenshots; see
  [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md#data-and-secrets).

## 🧪 Validator tests

`tools/test_excel_evidence.py` runs inside `python tools/check.py`
(`tool-tests`). It uses synthetic records and a temporary Git repository to
cover a valid record and wrong source identity, a different candidate,
incomplete and interrupted execution, failed cleanup, import, compile and test
failures, failure records that contradict their logs, timeouts that claim
results or cite a finished log,
injected-failure or repeated logs, tampered, missing, escaping or
symlinked logs, environment and reference mismatches, unavailable records and
the command-line exit codes. Those tests are not Excel evidence.

The validator and policy are adapted from EXCEL-VBA-PROJECT-TEMPLATE at commit
`b903fe44ef6a032c4689870b83745afa1c22490d`. SACCR keeps manual execution only,
derives the source inventory from the repository layout instead of a profile
file, requires the default references, binds the harness `ENVIRONMENT` line, and
does not include the template's release-evidence binding.
