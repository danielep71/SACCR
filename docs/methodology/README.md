# 📐 Methodology

This directory records **what SACCR implements and on what authority**: the
regulatory texts and their versions, assumptions, parameter sources, open
decisions, and the trace from each rule to code and tests. The numerical
test-case format is in [`TEST_CASES.md`](TEST_CASES.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The engine implements CRR and Basel CRE52. Under
> [`TEST_CASES.md`](TEST_CASES.md), only Basel rules are validated, by the
> published CRE99 examples (T01–T14); no CRR rule is validated in v1.0.0
> ([decision 8](#assumptions-and-scope)). The [traceability](#traceability)
> table gives the status of each rule. The CRR and CRE52 versions in the
> source register and the supervisory parameters were checked against the
> official texts on 2026-10-09.

## ⚖️ Regulatory basis

Decided by the owner on 2026-10-06 in issue #8.

| Regime | Identifier | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EU Capital Requirements Regulation, SA-CCR | `CRR` | **Baseline.** Default for every calculation and test case |
| Basel Framework, CRE52 | `BCBS` | Also supported; implemented as differences from the baseline |

A caller may choose the regime; when it does not, the facade uses `CRR`. Every
result reports the regime it was calculated under, and every expected result
names its regime. Where the two texts agree, the engine has one implementation
tagged with both rule identifiers. Where they differ, the difference is recorded
in [Regime differences](#regime-differences) before any code depends on it.

## 📚 Source register

Cite sources by ID in code `REFERENCE` sections, in the traceability table and
in test cases. Record the exact version date when a source is first relied on;
a later version is a new row, not an edit.

| ID | Source | Scope relied on | Version / date | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CRR` | Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 3 (Articles 274–280f), as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 and Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 | SA-CCR exposure value, replacement cost, PFE, add-ons | Consolidated text of 26.06.2026 (version 021.001), EUR-Lex | Articles 274(2)–(7), 275, 277, 277a, 278(3), 279a–279c, 280–280f and 285(2)–(5) checked 2026-10-09; Article 278(1)–(2) checked 2026-10-10 in the EUR-Lex PDF |

## 🧭 Assumptions and scope

| Topic | Current position |
| --- | --- |
| Units | Amounts in the netting set's calculation currency, unscaled; rates and factors as decimals; periods in years. See [`VBA_HOUSE_STYLE.md`](../VBA_HOUSE_STYLE.md#units-and-domains) |
| Inputs | Trade-level data supplied by the caller; SACCR does not price trades or source market data |
| Supervisory parameters | Taken from the cited regime text and recorded in the parameter table below, never typed in code without a reference |
| Running test cases | Decided 2026-10-06 (decision 7, #44): VBA generated from the JSON by a checked tool; cases feed the engine through its input sheets. See [`TEST_CASES.md`](TEST_CASES.md#consumption) |
| Evidence for v1.0.0 | Decided 2026-10-09 (decision 8, #44): v1.0.0 validates rules only with the `published` values of BCBS 279 Annex 4 (CRE99), checked against the registered text. It has no `independent` values: the project has one maintainer, who also wrote the code under test. Every other case stays `illustrative`. Because the published examples are Basel examples, rules under `CRR` are implemented but not validated in v1.0.0, and the release says so. A later release cross-checks the results against a second source |
| Sources | Decided 2026-10-09 (decisions 1 and 2, #33): `CRR` is the consolidated CRR of 26.06.2026 (version 021.001), checked on 2026-10-09, with Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/931 as amended by (EU) 2025/855 and EBA Q&A 2023_6962; `BCBS` is the Basel Framework CRE52 effective 1 January 2023, last updated 5 June 2020, checked on 2026-10-09 |
| Scope | Decided 2026-10-09 (decision 3, #33): the full SA-CCR only. Simplified SA-CCR (CRR Article 281), the original exposure method (Article 282), exposures to central counterparties, securities financing transactions, CVA and RWA are outside v1.0.0. They are planned as simplified SA-CCR in #107 (v1.2.0), the original exposure method in #111 (v1.3.0), CCP exposures in #112 (v1.4.0), SFTs in #113 (v1.5.0), CVA in #114 (v1.6.0) and RWA in #115 (v1.7.0). Inputs that ask for them are rejected; a limitation stated only in prose is not enough |
| Margined netting sets | Decided 2026-10-09 (decision 4, #33): in scope for v1.0.0, with VM, NICA, threshold, MTA and MPOR as inputs |
| Day count | Decided 2026-10-09 (decision 5, #33), confirmed after the CRR check: S, E, M and T in years of 365 calendar days (`DaysPerYear`); floors and MPOR in business days of 250 a year (`BusinessDaysPerYear`). Articles 279b and 279c say "the relevant business day convention"; this is the convention SACCR uses, without holiday calendars. A test case may set `DaysPerYear` to reproduce a published maturity |
| Currency | Decided 2026-10-09 (decision 6, #33): trade amounts are converted into the reporting currency with the FX table on Params, whose rates the user supplies; SACCR sources no market data. A test fixture holds amounts already in its calculation currency, whose rate is set to 1 |
| Interest-rate aggregation | Decided 2026-10-09 (decision 9, #33): under `BCBS` both CRE52.57 formulas are supported, chosen with `IRBucketOffset`: the bucket formula that recognises offsets across maturity buckets, and the sum of absolute bucket values. Under `CRR` only what Article 280a allows is supported, once its text is checked. Each supported formula needs a value test |
| Open treatments | Decided 2026-10-09 (decision 10, #33), revised after the CRR check: climatic conditions take 18% (Articles 277a(1)(e)(v), 280e(5)); there is no unrated sub-class, and the user enters CQS3, CQS5 where Article 128 applies, or the step mapped from an internal rating (Article 280c(5)(a)); other risks keep one hedging set per identical primary risk driver (Article 277a(1)(f)); inflation is interest rate, entered as a currency followed by `-INFL` (such as `EUR-INFL`) in its own hedging set (Articles 277(4)(a), 277a(1)); the optional reductions for sold options and sold credit protection (Article 274(5) and (7)) are not applied, which gives a higher exposure value and is permitted; several margin agreements in one netting set and one agreement over several netting sets (Articles 274(4), 275(3)) move to #39 |

<a id="support-matrix"></a>

## 🧾 Support matrix

What v1.0.0 calculates, what the user must enter in a supported form, and what
is outside it (#33). "Not supported" means the input sheets cannot express the
case; nothing is calculated for it. Whether a supported rule is also validated
is in the [traceability](#traceability) table.

| Area | Item | Status | How it is entered or treated | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Methods | Full SA-CCR, CRR (default) and Basel CRE52, chosen per netting set | Supported | Regime on Params, override per netting set | Decisions 1–3 |

| Netting sets | One-way margin agreement where only the bank posts VM | Entered by the user; under review | Enter as unmargined with the posted VM; tests to add in #39 | CRE52.2, CRE52.10 footnote 2 |
| Netting sets | Several margin agreements in one netting set; one agreement over several netting sets | Not supported | Cannot be expressed; a declaration or support is planned in #39 | CRR Art. 274(4), 275(3); CRE52.74–.76 |
| Netting sets | Client clearing | Supported with a user declaration | Cleared = Y applies the 5-business-day MPOR floor; eligibility is the user's to check (#39) | CRR Art. 279c(1)(b) |

## ❓ Open decisions

These are deliberately undecided. Each is settled by the owner in an issue and
moved into the tables above; none may be assumed by code or tests meanwhile.

None at present.

Decisions 1 to 6, 9 and 10 were settled on 2026-10-09 in #33 and are recorded
in [Assumptions and scope](#assumptions-and-scope).

## 🔀 Regime differences

Each confirmed difference between `CRR` and `BCBS` that affects a result gets a
row, with locators in both texts. No difference is asserted until both texts
have been compared for that rule.

| Topic | `CRR` (locator) | `BCBS` (locator) | Effect | Test cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Interest-rate aggregation across maturity buckets | Only the formula with offsets (Art. 280a(3)) | The formula with offsets, or the sum of absolute bucket values at the bank's choice (CRE52.57(5)) | `IRBucketOffset` = FALSE is valid only under `BCBS` | `TEST_Invariants` (relation) |
| Asset classes | Six, with other risks (Art. 277(1)(f), 280f: factor 8%) | Five (CRE52.72) | Other-risk trades are rejected under `BCBS` | T24, T25, T26 (illustrative) |
| Commodity hedging sets | Energy, metals, agricultural goods, other commodities and climatic conditions (Art. 277a(1)(e)); climatic conditions take 18% (Art. 280e(5)) | Energy, metals, agricultural and other commodities (CRE52.45, CRE52.70 step 2); CRE52.72 sets the factors by commodity type (electricity, oil/gas, metals, agricultural, other), not the hedging sets | Climatic trades form their own hedging set under `CRR` only | T27 (illustrative) |
| Single-name credit factor | By credit quality step 1–6 (Art. 280c(5), Table 3) | By rating AAA to CCC (CRE52.72) | Same values: 0.38%, 0.38%/0.42%, 0.54%, 1.06%, 1.6%, 6.0% | T28 (illustrative) |
| Supervisory delta of interest-rate and commodity options | Shifted by the regulatory lambda (`CRR-RTS` Art. 5) | CRE52.40 | Delta differs when a price or strike is near or below zero | T20–T23 (illustrative) |

The cap of a margined netting set is not recorded as a difference. Both texts
cap the EAD at that of the same netting set without margin (CRR Art. 274(3);
CRE52.2), and both define the unmargined collateral without variation margin:
CRR Art. 275(1) uses NICA (EBA Q&A 2023_6962), and CRE52.10 uses the net
collateral of the NICA methodology in CRE52.17, adding posted variation margin
with a negative sign only for a one-way margin agreement where the bank alone
posts (CRE52.10, footnote 2), which CRE52.2 treats as unmargined. The engine's
`BCBS` cap still includes variation margin (C = VM + NICA); this is examined in
#39 before any change.

How the points found in the CRR text are handled (#33):

- Article 280a prints only the formula with offsets across maturity buckets.
  With `IRBucketOffset` = FALSE, a `CRR` netting set with interest-rate trades
  is `INVALID` and its EAD withheld; `BCBS` netting sets may use either
  formula.
- Inflation trades are entered as `EUR-INFL` and similar, each in its own
  hedging set.
- The optional reductions of Article 274(5) and (7) are not applied
  ([decision 10](#assumptions-and-scope)). As printed, Article 274(5) allows a
  zero exposure value only for a netting set that consists solely of sold
  options, whose current market value is negative at all times, whose
  premiums were all received upfront, and that is not subject to a margin
  agreement. Article 274(7) allows a credit derivative long the underlying
  (protection sold) to be capped at the outstanding unpaid premium only if it
  is its own netting set, not subject to a margin agreement. CRE52.1 FAQ1 and
  FAQ2 give the Basel counterparts for options and protection outside netting
  and margin agreements. Implementing either would need these conditions as
  inputs.
- Article 274(4) and 275(3) cannot be expressed in the input sheets and are
  handled in #39.
- Article 280c(5)(b)(ii) (an unlisted multi-name credit position takes the
  notional-weighted factor of its constituents) is not automated: the user
  enters the resulting factor's credit quality step or a quoted index.

## 🔗 Traceability

One row per implemented rule. Rule IDs are the regime identifier and the
article or paragraph, for example `CRR.275.1` or `CRE52.<paragraph>`; `CRE52` alone
marks a paragraph not yet located. A rule shared by
both regimes lists both IDs.

Article numbers were checked against the CRR on 2026-10-09. CRE52 paragraph
numbers were checked against the CRE52 contents for EAD and alpha (.1), the cap
(.2), RC (.10, .18), PFE (.20), the multiplier (.22–.23), the aggregate add-on
(.25), supervisory duration (.34), adjusted notional (.35, .36), delta (.39,
.40, .41), basis and volatility (.46, .47, .73), maturity factor (.48–.49,
.52–.53), MPOR (.50, .51), interest rate (.56, .57), FX (.58, .59), credit
(.60, .61, .64), equity (.65, .66, .68), commodity (.69, .70) and the
parameters (.72).
CRE52.64 is about credit and CRE52.68 about equity factors; the code cited them
for equity and commodity until #33 corrected it. CRE52.65 and CRE52.69
introduce the equity and commodity offsets.
Test IDs `T01`–`T28` are listed in
[`tests/README.md`](../../tests/README.md#ported-prototype-catalogue). Status
uses four terms:

- **Validated**: a `published` output whose rule is this one passes in Excel
  for that regime. Only these count for the
  [completeness policy](TEST_CASES.md#completeness-policy).
- **Exercised**: no published output names the rule, but a published value
  that passes depends on it, so an error in it would very probably fail that
  value. Not counted as validated.
- **Not validated**: implemented; any cases are illustrative.
- **Not implemented**: listed below the table.

CRE52.51 and Art. 285(4) double the floor; the engine doubles the floor plus the remargining period, which differs when remargining is not daily (#39) |
| `CRE52.57`, `CRR.280a` | Interest rate: hedging set per currency (CRE52.57(2)), maturity buckets (.57(3)), bucket formula or, under `BCBS` only, sum of absolutes (.57(5)) | `CORE_Engine.ProcessTrades`, `SACCR_IREffectiveNotional`, `CORE_Engine.ComputeHedgingSets` | Published: T03.

Not implemented, as recorded on the template's Basel_vs_CRR sheet; where the
sheet says so, the user enters such trades in a form the engine supports: several margin agreements in one netting set
(CRE52, `CRR.274.4`); one margin agreement covering several netting sets
(`CRR.275.3`); the special treatment of sold options and sold credit
protection (`CRR.274.5`, `CRR.274.7`); decomposition of option combinations
(`CRR.274.6`); automated mapping of risk drivers (`CRR.277.2`, `CRR.277.3`);
simplified SA-CCR (`CRR.281`) and the original exposure method (`CRR.282`).
Collateral is an input after haircuts, and trade amounts are converted with
the FX table on Params ([decision 6](#assumptions-and-scope)); neither is
validated.

A rule is **validated** only when at least one case with a `published` or
`independent` reference passes for it in each regime it claims; see the
[completeness policy](TEST_CASES.md#completeness-policy). Illustrative cases
never count.
