# 📚 Regulatory sources

Copies of the official texts SACCR's methodology was checked against, so that
anyone can verify a citation without searching for the right version. They are
the public versions published by the EU and the Basel Committee; the
[source register](../README.md#source-register) says which rules rely on which
text.

These are documentation copies. The authentic EU texts are those published in
the Official Journal of the European Union; the authoritative Basel text is the
one on bis.org. A newer version is added as a new file next to the old one, with
its own row below; a file is never replaced.

The CRR extract was cut from the full consolidated PDF (SHA-256
`6796302ed4213bcba4d4b9b17dc48aefcaf7ef586b875c30c8c71a7689288ecf`, 895 pages)
without changing the pages. It covers the definitions (Article 272), the SA-CCR
articles (273a–282) and the margin period of risk (Article 285(2)–(5)).

BCBS 279 (2014), whose Annex 4a prints the same worked examples as CRE99, is
not copied: its address on bis.org no longer returns the PDF, and every
published value used by the test cases is cited from CRE99.
