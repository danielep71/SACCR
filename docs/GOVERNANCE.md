# Repository governance

Owner and maintainer: **@danielep71**. Active release branch: **`release/1.0.0`**.
Setup milestone v0.0.1 is closed; its baseline is recorded in
[issue #13](https://github.com/danielep71/VBA-SACCR-Toolkit/issues/13).
This policy implements the owner's working-branch decision of 2026-10-06 and
the scope of [issue #2](https://github.com/danielep71/VBA-SACCR-Toolkit/issues/2).

## Branch policy

| Branch | Purpose and allowed work |
| --- | --- |
| `release/1.0.0` | Active integration branch for all development, opened from `main` at the v0.0.1 closeout. |
| `main` | Default branch. Receives the active release branch only through an owner-requested PR merged with a merge commit. Nothing is committed to main directly. |
| Short-lived task branches | Every change: branch from the active release branch, open the PR against it and squash-merge it. Use a descriptive name such as `fix/<issue>-<slug>`, `docs/<slug>` or `chore/<slug>`. |
| Other `release/*` branches | Reserved for explicitly agreed future milestones; do not infer a new development target from a version number. |

The default branch remains `main`; this does not make it the active development
branch. Check the PR base explicitly. Closing a milestone does not publish a
tag, release or workbook, or authorize an automatic merge into main. The owner
must agree the final integration and subsequent working branch.

Task PRs into the release branch are squash-merged. Integration of the release
branch into main uses a PR merged with a merge commit once hosted checks are
green, so provenance remains visible. Automatic head-branch deletion removes the
release branch when that PR merges; recreate it from main at the merge commit,
or, at a milestone closeout, open the next release branch there instead, so the
active branch and main start level. Never force-push or reset shared branches.
Do not open a release-to-main PR just to record progress.

## Ownership, authorization and review

The owner sets scope, priorities, exceptions and release decisions. Contributors
work within the authorized issue. Every change reaches the active release
branch through a PR; nothing is committed directly to the release branch or
main. Inspect the diff and run the applicable checks before pushing. An
author's self-check is not an independent review.

No change to visibility, paid subscriptions, security-sensitive access or
main-branch scope is implied by an ordinary development task. Raise a concrete
exception when needed rather than bypassing a requirement. Keep unresolved
review findings and failed checks visible; do not call unavailable validation
successful.

Minimum review checklist, before integration or recording completion:

- [ ] The issue is assigned to danielep71, has a priority and the right milestone.
- [ ] Scope and acceptance criteria match the diff; the destination is the active release branch.
- [ ] Interfaces, units, error behavior, cleanup and compatibility impact are explained where relevant.
- [ ] Applicable local tests pass and the exact committed candidate is identified.
- [ ] Applicable hosted checks pass; PR validation covers the proposed range and reports are retained.
- [ ] Review findings are resolved or explicitly accepted with a reason and owner decision where needed.
- [ ] Documentation and Unreleased entries reflect actual behavior and validation.
- [ ] No credentials, client data, unrelated binary outputs or undeclared dependencies are introduced.
- [ ] Static results are separated from real Excel compilation/execution evidence.

Local validation (`python tools/check.py`) precedes every push; run
`python tools/check.py --ci` on the clean committed candidate, with
`--base <base-sha>` for a PR. Hosted checks must be green before a PR is
merged. Report static checks and real Excel runs separately. If a hosted run fails after a
merge, record the failure and fix or revert it through a new PR before closing
the issue. Never rewrite shared history to conceal the failed candidate.

## Issue metadata and completion

Every issue must have assignee **danielep71**, at least one priority label
**P1/P2/P3**, and a reference milestone; use one clear priority unless a
documented reason requires otherwise. Each issue belongs to the milestone of the release branch it targets.
Exception: traffic alert issues opened by the daily traffic export get the
assignee and **P3** automatically and no milestone; they are operational
analytics, not development work, and are closed once reviewed.
Include objective, acceptance checklist, dependencies and required evidence.

### What is automatic and what is not

| Field | How it is set |
| --- | --- |
| Assignee `danielep71` | Set by every issue form |
| Type label (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`) | Set by the form |
| Priority | Each form sets a default (`P2`, or `P3` for documentation); triage confirms or changes it |
| Milestone | **Manual.** GitHub issue forms cannot set a milestone |

Forms apply to web issues created through a form. `blank_issues_enabled: false`
hides ordinary blank issues, but users with Write, Maintain or Admin access
can still use the **Maintainers only** blank-issue option. Those issues, and
issues created through the API, CLI or another tool, bypass the forms and get
no metadata automatically. Nothing blocks an issue that lacks
metadata: this is a **manual rule backed by the check below**, not enforcement.

### Triage check

Run these state-independent searches at issue triage and before milestone
closeout. Each must return no results. Closed issues are included because the
metadata rule applies to every issue, not only ongoing work. Keep the missing-
milestone search repository-wide: filtering by milestone would hide orphans.

- [Issues without a milestone](https://github.com/danielep71/VBA-SACCR-Toolkit/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20no%3Amilestone%20-author%3Aapp%2Fgithub-actions), excluding traffic alerts, which the workflow opens as `github-actions`
- [Issues without an assignee](https://github.com/danielep71/VBA-SACCR-Toolkit/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20no%3Aassignee)
- [Issues without a priority label](https://github.com/danielep71/VBA-SACCR-Toolkit/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20-label%3AP1%20-label%3AP2%20-label%3AP3)

The issue forms and the pull-request template are read by GitHub from the
default branch, so a change to them takes effect after the next integration
into `main`.

### Closing an issue

Close an issue only when every acceptance criterion has linked evidence: the
merged PR, the green check run and, for VBA, the Excel result. Record that
evidence in a closing comment. A blocked Excel run keeps the issue open.
Each milestone closes through its own closeout issue; v0.0.1 closed in
[issue #13](https://github.com/danielep71/VBA-SACCR-Toolkit/issues/13).

## Current GitHub controls and limitations

Observed for this private personal repository on 2026-10-06. During issue #2,
the owner upgraded the account: GitHub's Licensing page now confirms
**Current GitHub base plan: GitHub Pro**. The earlier Free-plan restriction is
historical, not a current blocker. Availability and activation are distinct.

| Control | Observed state and working response |
| --- | --- |
| Repository visibility | Private. Preserve it; public visibility is not a workaround for missing features. |
| Branch rulesets | Configured by the owner on 2026-10-06. `main`: pull request required, merge commits only, conversations resolved, **Repository integrity** required and up to date, no force pushes or deletion; repository admins may bypass only through a pull request. Release branches: pull request required, squash only, **Repository integrity** required; deletion is not restricted, so automatic head-branch deletion removes a release branch when it is merged into main. Settings → Rules is authoritative; keep following the review checklist for what rulesets cannot check. |
| Tag ruleset | `v*` tags: updates, deletions and force pushes blocked, so a published tag cannot move. Added by the owner at the v0.0.1 closeout. |
| Automatic head-branch deletion | Enabled by the owner on 2026-10-06. Merged PR branches are deleted automatically. |
| Wiki | Enabled on 2026-10-06, private with the repository and editable by collaborators only; no pages published. Authoritative documentation stays in versioned docs/. |
| Advanced code/secret scanning | Not offered in the current repository security settings. Do not claim CodeQL, secret scanning or push protection are active. Review code and credentials manually; this is not equivalent automated coverage. |
| Dependency graph and Dependabot alerts | Enabled. Review alerts rather than assuming a clean dependency graph proves application security. |
| Low-impact development-dependency alert auto-dismissal | Disabled by explicit owner decision. Keep those alerts visible. |
| Automatic Dependabot updates | Weekly update PRs for GitHub Actions, aimed at the active release branch, from `.github/dependabot.yml`; Dependabot reads it from `main`. Every update is reviewed and merged manually; see [tools/README.md](../tools/README.md#dependency-updates). Alerts and update PRs are separate features. |
| Repository integrity CI | Runs on main/release pushes and PRs, read-only token and full-SHA action pins. Also lints the Python tooling (Ruff, strict mypy) and the workflows (actionlint). Reports are retained for 30 days. Static checks only; no Excel execution. |
| Labels | Twenty-label catalogue with sync and read-only drift workflows. See LABELS.md for permissions and triggers. |
| Traffic history | Daily export of GitHub's 14-day traffic data to the orphan `traffic-history` branch, from `.github/workflows/daily-traffic.yml`, with an alert issue on a spike or new referrer. Needs `TRAFFIC_TOKEN` in the `analytics` environment and runs only once the workflow is on main. Analytics only, never CI. |

GitHub Pro enables capabilities such as protected branches, required reviewers
and Wiki in private personal repositories. It does not automatically configure
those controls and must not be represented as enabling all advanced security
products. The private repository's security settings still do not offer the
advanced code/secret-scanning sections after the upgrade.
Reference: [GitHub plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).
Recheck feature availability before future configuration changes. The
ruleset configuration and Wiki state above are the ones accepted at the v0.0.1
closeout in issue #13.

## Label workflows

Both branches carry the same label catalogue. Workflow/script revisions can
differ while release work awaits integration into main. PRs affecting them run offline validation. The automatic live sync
is triggered by changes to its inputs on main; scheduled drift uses the default
branch. Changes merged into the release branch alone do not trigger live sync.

If an authorized label-policy change is developed on release, validate it
locally and via PR checks, review removals and their issue associations, then
use an explicitly requested manual sync on that reviewed release ref when
live reconciliation is needed. Do not modify main solely to trigger sync.
The label workflows do not automatically assign priorities or milestones.

## Reconciled setup baseline

Before this reconciliation:

- main: `28af65c007b55434c1f95b7035e72b03ecdffe8e`;
- release/0.0.1: `2f8ef9d89702185c2afc1762157b71c07fe70d02`.

Both contained the same tooling and static workflow. Release lacked seven
label-policy, script, workflow and documentation files present in main.
The governance integration preserves both commits as parents, first the
release tip and then main, and imports those seven files unchanged into
release. Main stayed at the recorded tip at that point. The changelog states
release is the active setup branch, and the README links this policy.

PR #14 later merged the release branch into main with merge commit
`ff714896eabfb32a91659b7d80aa9ad9b5607496`. Immediately after that merge both
branches pointed to that commit, and hosted checks passed on it for both; the
release branch has moved on since.

The accepted integration commit, hosted run, branch comparison and settings
observations are recorded in issue #2. The final setup baseline is merge commit
`69209c4386733e934da5bbb1f8b2c2c6ae7bb059` (PR #48), recorded with its
evidence in issue #13; `release/1.0.0` was opened from it.
