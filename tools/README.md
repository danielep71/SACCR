# SACCR tooling

Requirements: Git and Python 3.10+ on PATH. `check.py` needs no Python packages
and no Excel. Run from the repository root before every push:

```sh
python tools/check.py
```

All gates must pass; findings return a nonzero exit code. Reports and logs go to
the ignored `test-results/` directory. `--ci` checks committed whitespace instead
of local edits and requires a clean tree; add `--base <base-sha>` to inspect a
pull request's whole range.

| Gate | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| `tool-tests` | Fixtures for the source gate and public-API roles (`test_tooling.py`), regression cases from reviews (`test_review_regressions.py`), synthetic Excel evidence records (`test_excel_evidence.py`), test-case files (`test_test_cases.py`) and the case-module generator (`test_generate_case_tests.py`) |
| `check_committed_whitespace-fixtures` | Self-test of the whitespace gate |
| `check_source` | Every tracked text file is stored with LF in Git (CRLF, mixed or lone-CR blobs declared as text fail); VBA components sit only in the locations defined in `docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`, and modules in `src/core/` declare `Option Private Module`; exported VBA (`.bas`, `.cls`, `.frm`) checks out as CRLF, decodes as cp1252, has `Option Explicit` and a `VB_Name` equal to its filename and unique in the project; each `.frm` references a tracked `.frx` large enough for its offset; `CHANGELOG.md` starts with `## [Unreleased]`, uses `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` release headings with real calendar dates and has a link reference for each; once a release exists, `VERSION` holds the newest one |
| `check_committed_whitespace` | `git diff --check` on staged and unstaged changes (local) or on the committed range (`--ci`) |
| `check_vba_jumps` | Every `GoTo`, `GoSub`, `Resume` and `On Error GoTo` target is a label in the same procedure |
| `check_vba_conditionals` | `#If`/`#ElseIf`/`#Else`/`#End If` are balanced and use only `VBA6`, `VBA7`, `Win32`, `Win64`; `Declare` in reachable 64-bit branches is `PtrSafe`; no `#Const` |
| `check_test_cases` | Every fixture and expected file under `tests/` follows `docs/methodology/TEST_CASES.md`: envelope, declared fields with their types and units, quantity names and forms, trade references, tolerances, reference classes with their required fields and registered sources, the `illustrative-` naming rule and unique catalogue IDs. It does not run any case |
| `check_vba_public_api` | Every `Public` declaration in `src/modules/` is listed, with its exact signature, in `docs/PUBLIC_API.txt`, and nothing else is; no implicit public procedures; one identifier per public `Const` or variable; no name collisions |
| `generated-case-tests` | `tests/modules/TEST_Cases.bas` is exactly what `tools/generate_case_tests.py` generates from the current fixtures and expected files |
| `*-fixtures` | Each VBA checker and the whitespace gate run their own positive and negative self-tests first |

`check_excel_evidence.py` is not a gate: it validates a manual Excel evidence
bundle against a candidate commit, and `--inventory` prints the source digests a
record needs. Its synthetic tests, `test_excel_evidence.py`, run in `tool-tests`.
See [`docs/EXCEL_EVIDENCE.md`](../docs/EXCEL_EVIDENCE.md).

These are static checks only. None of them compiles VBA, opens Excel, runs a
test harness or validates any SA-CCR number, and a pass is never evidence that
the workbook works in Excel.

## Local VBA synchronization

`Sync-SACCR-VBA.ps1` synchronizes the repository VBA source into an existing
local `.xlsm` development workbook without intentionally changing worksheets,
cells, formulas, names, tables or formatting.

For normal use on Windows, double-click `tools/Sync-SACCR-VBA.cmd`. The launcher asks for the full path of the local `.xlsm`, runs the PowerShell synchronizer, shows the result and pauses before closing. You can also drag an `.xlsm` file onto the `.cmd` file to avoid typing its path.

PowerShell remains available for direct use from the repository root:

```powershell
.\tools\Sync-SACCR-VBA.ps1 -WorkbookPath "C:\path\to\SACCR.xlsm"
```

The script reads `src/core/`, `src/modules/` and `src/workbook/`. Standard
modules are replaced from source; `ThisWorkbook` and worksheet document modules
keep their workbook objects and only their code text is replaced. It disables
Excel events, macro execution, external-link updates and automatic calculation
while synchronizing, checks that the sheet names/CodeNames are unchanged, and
creates a timestamped backup unless `-NoBackup` is supplied.

It requires Windows desktop Excel and Excel's **Trust access to the VBA project
object model** setting. The workbook VBA project must not be password-locked.

## VBA checkers: source and adaptations

`check_vba_jumps.py`, `check_vba_conditionals.py` and `check_vba_public_api.py`
come from EXCEL-VBA-PROJECT-TEMPLATE at commit
`b903fe44ef6a032c4689870b83745afa1c22490d`. SACCR now evaluates jumps per reachable compilation environment and checks
`PtrSafe` in the declaration modifier position. The
public-API checker takes each component's role from its folder, as defined in
[`docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`](../docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md): `src/modules/`
is public; the other `src/` folders are internal; `tests/` and `examples/` are
test and example. The template instead reads a component registry from
`.github/repository-profile.json`, which SACCR does not use. `test_tooling.py`
adds fixtures for that role mapping. `test_review_regressions.py` covers the
post-merge findings, including colon-separated public declarations.

### Direct-call validation: evaluated, not adopted yet

VBA-DATETIMEPICKER's `check_vba_calls.py` resolves direct, module-qualified and
typed-class calls, argument counts and literal `Application.Run`/`OnAction`
targets. It reports anything it cannot resolve (calls through `Object` or
`Variant`, library members, dynamic names) as *unknown*, not as a defect. That
repository runs it as advisory only, because it needs a per-project manifest of
VBA projects and its value grows with the number of modules.

The imported prototype engine now spans three core modules, a facade and the
workbook macros, so adopting it, advisory first, is due with the engine
refactor. Until then the VBA compiler in Excel is the call-resolution check.

## GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/static-checks.yml` runs the same command with `--ci` on
pull requests targeting `main` or `release/**`, pushes to those branches, and
manual dispatch. It is installed on both `main` and the active release branch.
The job is named **Repository integrity**.

Pull requests pass their base SHA through `--base` to check the complete
proposed change. Checkout fetches the full history and verifies the exact
event SHA; for pull requests this is GitHub's test merge commit.
Push and manual runs use the runner's first-parent whitespace scope.

All gates must pass. Reports and logs from `test-results/` are uploaded
even when checks fail and retained for 30 days. The artifact name includes
the candidate SHA, run ID and attempt; `static-checks.json` also records the
candidate SHA. Missing evidence fails the upload step.

The workflow uses a read-only token, does not persist checkout credentials,
and pins actions to full commit SHAs taken from the template.
It uses GitHub-hosted Ubuntu and Python 3.10.
A successful job is static-check evidence only, not Excel validation.

After `check.py`, the same job runs three quality steps. Each runs even if an
earlier step failed, so one run reports every problem, and each failure fails the
job:

| Step | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| Ruff | `ruff check tools` with the rules in `pyproject.toml`; a probe proves the complexity ceiling of 15 is active |
| mypy | `mypy --strict` over every module in `tools/`, tests included; a probe proves an unannotated function is rejected |
| actionlint | Every workflow in `.github/workflows/`, including shellcheck on `run:` scripts |

Ruff and mypy install from `tools/requirements-quality-ci.txt` with
`--require-hashes --only-binary=:all:`. The actionlint archive is downloaded at a
pinned version and verified against its SHA-256 before use. Their outputs are in
the uploaded report. To run Ruff and mypy locally, with Python 3.10:

```sh
python -m pip install --require-hashes --only-binary=:all: -r tools/requirements-quality-ci.txt
ruff check tools
mypy
```

## Traffic history

`.github/workflows/daily-traffic.yml`, adapted from VBA-DATETIMEPICKER, runs
daily at 06:00 UTC and on manual dispatch, from the default branch only. It
reads GitHub's traffic API, which keeps just 14 days, and appends the snapshot
to CSV files under `data/` on the orphan `traffic-history` branch: totals,
daily views and clones, referrers and popular paths. The first run creates the
branch. It also opens an alert issue, assigned and labelled **P3**, on a views
or clones spike, a new star or fork, or a new referrer with at least five
views.

It needs a fine-grained personal access token with `Administration: read` on
this repository, stored as `TRAFFIC_TOKEN` in the `analytics` environment;
without it the run fails with a clear error. The badge files it writes under
`data/badges/` work in a README only once the repository is public. This is
analytics, not CI: it runs no repository code and must never be extended to.

## Dependency updates

`.github/dependabot.yml` asks Dependabot for weekly version updates of the
GitHub Actions pinned in the workflows. They are opened against the active
release branch (`target-branch`) and labelled `ci` and `P3`. Dependabot reads
this file from the default branch; PR #24 integrated it into `main`. Update `target-branch` whenever a new release branch is opened.

Review each update pull request like any other:

1. Check the new version's release notes and the commit it pins. The pin must
   stay a full 40-character SHA with the version as a trailing comment.
2. Let **Repository integrity** run, including actionlint, and confirm it is
   green.
3. Squash-merge it yourself. Nothing is merged or approved automatically, and
   Dependabot alerts are never dismissed automatically.

The quality tools are not covered by Dependabot. To change Ruff, mypy or
actionlint, update the version and its hash or checksum in
`tools/requirements-quality-ci.txt` or the workflow `env` in one reviewed pull
request.
Whether GitHub blocks merging on this check depends on the repository's
branch rulesets.


## Wiki publication

All GitHub Wiki pages are source-controlled under `docs/wiki/`. The published
Wiki is a derived artifact; do not maintain an independent copy through the
GitHub Wiki editor.

Run `python tools/check_wiki.py --root .` to validate the page catalogue,
authority notices and generated sidebar. The normal `python tools/check.py`
gate runs the same check and its offline tests.

On Windows, double-click `tools/Publish-SACCR-Wiki.cmd`. It derives the Wiki
remote from this repository's `origin`, uses a sibling local Wiki checkout,
publishes the complete reviewed page set, writes `Wiki-Source.json`, pushes
only when content changed and performs a fresh-clone read-back verification.

See [`docs/WIKI_PUBLICATION.md`](../docs/WIKI_PUBLICATION.md).
