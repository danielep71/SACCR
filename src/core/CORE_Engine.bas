' MODULE: CORE_Engine
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' PURPOSE
'   Calculate SA-CCR exposure at default (EAD) for every netting set on the
'   input sheets, and write the intermediate and final figures to the output
'   sheets.
'
'     EAD = alpha * (RC + PFE)                                    [CRE52.1]
'     PFE = multiplier * aggregate add-on                         [CRE52.20]
'     aggregate add-on = sum of the asset-class add-ons           [CRE52.25]
'     trade effective notional = delta * d * MF
'
'   The EAD of a margined netting set is capped at the EAD of the same
'   netting set calculated as if it were unmargined.             [CRE52.2]
'
' REGIME LAYER
'   The regime is set on Params (CRR by default) and can be overridden per
'   netting set.
'   BCBS: the cap uses C = VM + NICA, with posted VM negative.    [CRE52.2]
'   CRR:  the cap follows Art. 274(3), with RC per Art. 275(1) and C = NICA
'         only, excluding VM posted or received (EBA Q&A 2023_6962).
'   CRR:  the other-risks class OT, supervisory factor 8%.       [Art. 280f]
'   CRR:  lambda for interest-rate and commodity options per Delegated
'         Regulation (EU) 2021/931 Art. 5.
'   A row of the supervisory-factor table can be limited to one regime in
'   its Regimes column.
'
' FLOW
'   Calculate runs, in order:
'     ClearOutputSheets, ValidateSchema: clear old results, check the layout;
'     LoadParams, LoadSFTable, LoadFXTable, LoadNettingSets: read the inputs;
'     ProcessTrades: one row per trade, collected into buckets;
'     ComputeHedgingSets: buckets into hedging-set and asset-class add-ons;
'     ComputeNettingSets: RC, multiplier, PFE and EAD per netting set;
'     WriteBuckets, WriteHedgingSets, WriteChecks, WriteRunInfo: outputs.
'   Each trade, bucket and hedging set is stored once in an array, with a
'   Collection (see CORE_Util.KeyIndex) mapping its key to its array position.
'
' PUBLIC SURFACE
'   None outside this VBA project. Calculate, the run counters and the
'   run-fingerprint procedures (InputFingerprint, LastRunInputs,
'   ForgetRunInputs) are Public for M_Main; Option Private Module keeps them
'   off the supported external surface.
'
' DEPENDENCIES
'   CORE_Config for the layout, CORE_Util for conversions and sheet access, and
'   SACCR_Formulas for every regulatory formula.
'
' STATE OWNERSHIP
'   Owns the module state below. ResetState clears it at the start of each
'   run; the run counters stay readable until the next run. Reads the input
'   sheets and Params; writes the TradeCalc, Buckets, HedgingSets, Results
'   and Checks sheets. Changes no Excel application setting.
'
' ERROR POLICY
'   Invalid inputs are not VBA errors. They are logged as ERROR, WARNING or
'   INFO lines for the Checks sheet: an invalid trade is excluded and the
'   run continues; invalid parameters or netting sets stop the run.
'   LoadParams, WriteChecks and WriteRunInfo contain their own errors. A
'   Checks sheet that cannot be written withdraws the results and raises
'   ERR_CHECKS_WRITE (#36). Any other unexpected error during a run also
'   withdraws the results, is logged on Checks and in the run summary, and
'   is raised unchanged to M_Main (#36).
'
' KNOWN DEVIATION
'   This module lives in src/core but reads and writes worksheets, which the
'   repository structure reserves for src/workbook. See the known deviations
'   in docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md.
'
' COMPATIBILITY
'   Excel VBA; no references beyond the defaults.

' PURPOSE
'   Run the engine once: load the inputs, calculate every trade, hedging set
'   and netting set, and write the outputs.
'
' INPUTS
'   writeOutputs: True writes every output sheet; False validates only and
'   writes the Checks sheet alone.
'
' RETURNS
'   True when the run completed. Individual trades may still have been
'   excluded; the Checks sheet lists them. False when the sheet layout is
'   not as expected, or a parameter, the factor or FX table, or the netting
'   sets could not be loaded.
'
' ERROR POLICY
'   Raises ERR_CHECKS_WRITE when the Checks sheet cannot be written, after
'   clearing the other output sheets: results whose errors and warnings
'   cannot be shown must not look valid, and the Checks sheet would still
'   hold the previous run's messages (#36). Any other error during the run
'   clears the output sheets too, so that a run stopped halfway cannot
'   leave tables from two runs, is logged on Checks and in the run summary,
'   and is raised with its original number, source and description, with
'   any output-cleanup or Checks-write diagnostics appended.

' STATE OWNERSHIP
