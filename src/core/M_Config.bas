' MODULE: M_Config
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' PURPOSE
'   Hold every layout constant the SA-CCR engine depends on: sheet names,
'   header and first data rows, the column of each input field, the width of
'   each output table, parameter codes, regime and asset-class codes, the
'   severity labels written to the Checks sheet, the expected column
'   headers, and the error numbers raised by the workbook macros. When a
'   sheet layout changes, it changes here and nowhere else.
'
' PUBLIC SURFACE
'   None outside this VBA project. The constants are Public for in-project use
'   by M_Util, M_Engine and M_Main; Option Private Module keeps them off the
'   supported external surface.
'
' DEPENDENCIES
'   None. Every value is a literal.
'
' STATE OWNERSHIP
'   Constants only; no state.
'
' ERROR POLICY
'   Not applicable.
'
' COMPATIBILITY
'   Excel VBA; no references beyond the defaults.
