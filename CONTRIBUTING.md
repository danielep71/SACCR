This document is authoritative for the **contribution and review workflow**.
Branch, issue and review policy is owned by
[`docs/GOVERNANCE.md`](docs/GOVERNANCE.md); developer setup by

[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md); publication by [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).

Participation is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Suspected vulnerabilities must never be disclosed in an issue or pull request.

## 🌱 Ways to contribute

| Contribution | First action |
| --- | --- |
| 🐛 Reproducible defect | Open an issue with exact commit, environment, expected and observed behavior, and evidence. |
| ✨ Feature or calculation change | Open an issue defining the regulatory basis, observable contract, compatibility, non-goals and validation. |
| 🧪 Test or evidence improvement | Explain provenance, independence, coverage and what failure the test detects. |
| 📖 Documentation | Identify the authoritative document being corrected. |
| ⚙️ Tooling or governance | Explain failure behavior, portability, trust boundary and maintenance cost. |
| 🔐 Security concern | Follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) privately. |

Open issues with the forms (bug, feature or calculation change, documentation).
Every issue is assigned to `danielep71`, carries one priority label (`P1`, `P2`
or `P3`) and has the relevant milestone; the forms set the first two, and triage
sets the milestone. See
[issue metadata and completion](docs/GOVERNANCE.md#issue-metadata-and-completion).
Pull requests follow [the PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## 🌿 Development workflow

1. Start from the active release branch, currently `release/1.0.0`. Never assume
   GitHub's default branch is the right base.
2. Create one focused task branch with a descriptive name in the repository
   convention: `fix/<issue>-<slug>`, `docs/<slug>` or `chore/<slug>`.
3. Reproduce the current behavior before changing it.
4. Define the observable contract, affected callers, compatibility impact and
   validation plan.
5. Make the smallest coherent change; avoid unrelated formatting, generated
   output or opportunistic refactoring.
6. Run `python tools/check.py` before every push. All gates must pass.
7. Update the affected documentation and add a user-facing entry under
   `## [Unreleased]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
8. Review the complete diff, then open a pull request **against the release
   branch** with evidence and explicit limitations.
9. Pull requests into the release branch are squash-merged once the
   **Repository integrity** check is green and review findings are resolved.
   Merged branches are deleted automatically.

Nothing is committed directly to the release branch or to `main`. Integration
of the release branch into `main` happens only on the owner's request; see
[`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).

### Commit messages

Write an imperative subject line, then a body that states:

- **what** changed;
- **why** it changed; and
- **what was validated** at that commit, separating static checks from Excel
  runs.

Reference the issue when one exists. Do not place credentials, private links,
attribution boilerplate or unverifiable test claims in commit messages.

## 📦 Source-change discipline

The repository-control files define how source is stored:

- exported VBA (`.bas`, `.cls`, `.frm`) is the reviewable source of truth. It
  is stored with LF in Git and checked out with CRLF;
- component filenames match their `VB_Name`, and every module declares
  `Option Explicit`;
- `.frm`/`.frx` pairs stay together, and `.frx` stays binary;
- workbooks and add-ins are generated artifacts, ignored by Git unless an exact
  path is re-included; a workbook is never the only record of a source change;
  and
- test data and examples are synthetic.

`python tools/check.py` enforces the storage, naming, placement and
`Option Explicit` rules, plus the VBA jump, conditional-compilation and
public-API checks.
Where each component belongs, the dependency direction and the public-API
boundary are defined in
[`docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`](docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md); supported
declarations are listed in [`docs/PUBLIC_API.txt`](docs/PUBLIC_API.txt). Naming,
contracts, errors and Excel-state handling follow
[`docs/VBA_HOUSE_STYLE.md`](docs/VBA_HOUSE_STYLE.md); import and export follow
[`INSTALLATION.md`](INSTALLATION.md#importing-vba-into-excel).

Do not weaken a calculation, numerical or packaging gate merely because the
generic repository gate passes.

## 🔄 Compatibility and calculation contracts

A change to documented procedures, functions, classes, enums, parameters,
defaults, return values, errors, side effects, input or output layouts, or
supported platforms is a contract change. So is any change that alters a
computed exposure, add-on, replacement cost or multiplier for the same inputs.

Such a contribution must identify callers and migration impact, update
regression coverage, update the user documentation and state the release
impact. A calculation change must also cite the regulatory provision or
published example it implements.

Excel and Windows state belongs to the caller or host unless a component
explicitly owns it. Capture before mutation, restore only state successfully
changed and still owned, and never let cleanup conceal the original failure.

## 🧪 Validation and evidence

Validation must be reproducible from the exact source under review. Record:

```text
Source
------
Commit:
Files or components changed:

Environment
-----------
Excel / Office build:
Office bitness:
Operating system:
Locale / date system:

Checks
------
python tools/check.py:
Compile (Debug → Compile VBAProject):
Regression harness:
Specific scenario verified:
Cleanup:

Limitations
-----------
Not run or unverified:
Follow-up:
```

Use only the applicable fields, but never omit a material limitation.

- **Static checks are not Excel evidence.** `tools/check.py` and the hosted
  workflow inspect files. They do not compile VBA or run Excel. Evidence that
  must be bound to an exact commit follows
  [`docs/EXCEL_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/EXCEL_EVIDENCE.md).
- **VBA changes are not merged until verified in Excel:** compile, run the
  harness, and exercise the specific scenario the change addresses. State
  plainly what was and was not run in Excel.
- **A skipped check is not a pass.**
- **Reference values must be independent** of the implementation under test,
  for example published regulatory examples or an independent calculation.

When sharing a VBA module for review or import, send the CRLF file from a Git
checkout. Do not use GitHub's **Raw** view, which serves the LF form stored in
Git.

## 🚀 Pull requests

A pull request answers five questions:

1. What problem does this solve?
2. What observable contract changes?
3. What remains compatible?
4. How was the exact source validated?
5. What remains unverified?

### Review checklist

- [ ] The PR targets the active release branch, and the related issue is linked.
- [ ] Scope is focused; calculation, API and compatibility impact are assessed.
- [ ] Exported VBA and required binary companions are synchronized.
- [ ] `python tools/check.py` passes, and the **Repository integrity** check is green.
- [ ] Excel compile, harness and scenario results are recorded for VBA changes.
- [ ] Error, boundary, recovery and cleanup paths are covered where affected.
- [ ] Documentation and the `[Unreleased]` changelog entry are updated.
- [ ] No confidential, real-portfolio, accidental binary or generated material is added.
- [ ] Unverified environments and skipped checks are stated plainly.
- [ ] The final diff contains no unrelated formatting or local artifacts.

The full review checklist is in
[`docs/GOVERNANCE.md`](docs/GOVERNANCE.md#ownership-authorization-and-review).
Discussion stays technical and respectful under the
