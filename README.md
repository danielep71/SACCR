## ✨ What this project is

**SA-CCR (Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk)** is the Basel
regulatory framework for determining the exposure at default (EAD) of derivative
transactions and long-settlement transactions. It is a standardized,
non-modelled approach that reflects current exposure, potential future exposure,
netting, collateral and margining arrangements.

**SA-CCR Benchmark** is an independent Excel/VBA toolkit designed to reproduce,
test and reconcile SA-CCR calculations under the Basel Framework and EU CRR.

See [SA-CCR Overview](docs/wiki/SA-CCR-Overview.md) for the regulatory concepts,
calculation structure and validation approach.

## 🧭 Status

Repository setup, milestone **v0.0.1**, is complete; its accepted baseline is
recorded in [issue #13](https://github.com/danielep71/VBA-SACCR-Toolkit/issues/13). The
prototype engine (CRR and Basel CRE52) has been imported as source; it is not
yet validated under the repository's test-case policy. SACCR uses the **application** profile: the
deliverable is a workbook built from the exported source, around a
host-independent calculation core
([repository structure](docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md)). Setup established:

- repository conventions, static checks and CI;
- governance, issue metadata and labels;
- the methodology basis, CRR with Basel CRE52 also supported, and the numerical
  test-case format ([`docs/methodology/`](docs/methodology/README.md)); and
- Excel evidence bound to a commit ([`docs/EXCEL_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/EXCEL_EVIDENCE.md))
  and the first real Excel smoke test (#9).

Nothing has been released. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for what has been
added so far.

## 🌿 Development

Development takes place on the active release branch, `release/1.0.0`. Every
change goes through a task branch and a pull request into that branch. Changes
to `main` require an explicit owner instruction.

## 🚀 Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/danielep71/VBA-SACCR-Toolkit.git
cd VBA-SACCR-Toolkit
git switch release/1.0.0
python tools/check.py
```

Requirements, the import procedure and troubleshooting are in
[`INSTALLATION.md`](INSTALLATION.md).
