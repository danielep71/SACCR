# 🧪 Tests

`tests/` holds all verification source and stable test data. Layout rules are in
[`docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`](../docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md).

| Location | Contents | Defined in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modules/` | Regression modules; `TEST_Harness.bas` is the harness and its entry point | #7 |
| `fixtures/` | Synthetic inputs: trades, netting sets, collateral terms | [`TEST_CASES.md`](../docs/methodology/TEST_CASES.md) |
| `expected/` | Expected values per regime, each with its reference class and source | [`TEST_CASES.md`](../docs/methodology/TEST_CASES.md) |

The harness entry point is `TEST_Harness.RunTests`. How to run it and what a
passing log looks like is in
[`INSTALLATION.md`](../INSTALLATION.md#running-the-harness). Each other
subdirectory is created with its first real file.

Rules:

- Test modules are never part of the production import set.
- Fixtures are synthetic. Never commit real trades, counterparties, collateral
  agreements or portfolio extracts.
- Expected values come from a source independent of the implementation, such as
  published regulatory examples. Cases named `illustrative-*` hold only
  illustrative values: they show a behaviour and validate nothing.
- Run output, logs and generated workbooks are not committed.
- `python tools/check.py` validates every fixture and expected file against
  the format (`check_test_cases`) and checks that the generated
  `modules/TEST_Cases.bas` is current. `TEST_Cases.RunCaseTests` runs them in
  Excel through `modules/TEST_CaseRunner.bas`.

## Ported prototype catalogue

The 28 checks of the prototype workbook's TestCatalogue sheet (#59), with the
catalogue's expected value. Inputs come from the template's NettingSets and
Trades sheets, valued on 2026-09-30. The `cre99-example-*` cases are in USD,
unscaled: CRE99 prints USD thousands, so their amounts and expected values are
the printed figures times 1,000, with a tolerance of half a printed unit
(500 USD). The other cases keep the template's figures, labelled EUR. Netting sets
that the workbook duplicates per regime with identical inputs (`BCBS-EX5` and
`CRR-EX5`, `BCBS-VMCAP` and `CRR-VMCAP`, `BCBS-NEGIR` and `CRR-NEGIR`) are one
fixture with an expected file per regime. T22 and T26 read trades `NIR-B` and
`OT-X` in the workbook; the fixtures hold the same inputs as `NIR-C` and
`OT-1`. T28 needs only trade `B03` of `NS-GAMMA`.

`published` values are printed in the Basel Framework chapter CRE99 (and BCBS
279 Annex 4a), rounded to the printed digit. Example 4 (T08 to T10) was checked
against the text on 2026-10-09; the others are the catalogue's transcription,
still to be checked. Example 3 prints a residual maturity of 9 months for trade
1, so its case runs with `DaysPerYear` 360 and 270 days to give exactly 0.75
years. `illustrative` values came from a Python
implementation that is not in the repository or from unreviewed hand
calculations, and stay illustrative until an independent derivation is
committed and reviewed. Every expected value and tolerance matches the
catalogue, and the prototype engine's saved results in the template are within
each tolerance.
