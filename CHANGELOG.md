All notable changes to **SACCR** are documented here.

This changelog follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). It records
released behavior and material unreleased changes; it is not a commit log, issue
tracker, or substitute for release evidence.

---

## 🧭 Maintenance policy

- Add material changes under **Unreleased** in the same pull request as the
  behavior or documentation they describe.
- Write from the user's perspective: describe the observable result, contract,
  compatibility impact, and migration need.
- Link the owning issue or pull request when it contains useful engineering
  detail.
- Record only validation actually performed. Static checks are never Excel
  evidence; state what was and was not run in Excel.
- Move Unreleased entries into a dated version section only when a release is
  explicitly prepared.
- Do not edit a published release entry except to correct a demonstrable factual
  or link error; annotate material corrections instead of rewriting history.

### Date and version rules

| Rule | Standard |
|---|---|
| Version | `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, without the leading `v` in headings |
| Release heading | `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` |
| Date | Gregorian calendar date in ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` format |
| Ordering | Unreleased first; released versions newest to oldest |
| Comparison | Unreleased → latest tag; each release → preceding tag |
| Patch | Backward-compatible correction or hardening |
| Minor | Backward-compatible capability |
| Major | Incompatible public-contract change |

The repository remains below `1.0.0` while its supported surface is still
forming. Pre-release status does not excuse undocumented breaking changes.

| **Fixed** | Corrected defects |
| **Security** | Safely disclosed security corrections |
| **Documentation** | Material documentation-only changes |
| **Validation** | Evidence actually produced |
| **Compatibility** | Upgrade or migration effects |

## [Unreleased]

> Not yet released. Work is staged on `release/0.0.1`.

### Added

- Repository-control files adopted from the Excel VBA project template:
  `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore`. Exported VBA source is
  stored with LF in Git and checked out as CRLF; Office packages are binary and
  ignored unless an exact path is re-included.
- One local command, `python tools/check.py`, runs the static gates before every
  push: Git storage and line endings, exported VBA integrity (`Option Explicit`,
  `VB_Name`, form resources), changelog structure and whitespace. See
  [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md).
- Automatic **Repository integrity** checks on pull requests and pushes to
  `main` and `release/**`, plus manual execution. Reports and logs identify the
  checked commit and are retained for 30 days, including failed checks.
- This changelog.

### Known limitations

- The repository contains no VBA source yet, so the VBA checks have nothing to
  inspect. No check compiles VBA or runs Excel.
